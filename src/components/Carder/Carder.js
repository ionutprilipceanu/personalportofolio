              It all started in the summer of 2014. I was on summer vacation, when I was a student. I found a piece of pork skin and thought of making myself a wallet. I searched on youtube how to make leather wallets and what tools I need. I didn't have skin processing tools but I improvised. I broke a hair clipper and took the knives from it and so I had the first "tool" for leather, which I used to make holes so that I could sew the skin later. In the end I managed to make a leather wallet that I bragged about to my friends and here they were my first clients.

              <Card.Subtitle className="cardSubtitle">Present</Card.Subtitle>
              <Card.Text className="cardText">
              With the passage of time, quality products appeared, in the meantime I bought professional tools, I started working with other skin types, I learned to make patterns and use skin care products.

              I like challenges and that's why I started to expand my range of things made of leather, namely: wallets, bags, watch straps, trouser straps, dog collars, harnesses, agenda / book covers, keychains, bracelets, etc.
